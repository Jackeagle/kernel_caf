Description:
                If the permissive attribute is set, then writing a string in
                the format of DDDD:BB:DD.F-REG:SIZE:MASK will allow the guest
                to write and read from the PCI device. That is Domain:Bus:
                Device.Function-Register:Size:Mask (Domain is optional).
                For example:
                #echo 00:19.0-E0:2:FF > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/pciback/quirks
                will allow the guest to read and write to the configuration
                register 0x0E.

Description:
                A list of all of the PCI devices owned by Xen PCI back and
                whether Xen PCI backend will acknowledge the interrupts received
                and the amount of interrupts received. Xen PCI back acknowledges
                said interrupts only when they are level, shared with another
                guest, whether it will acknowledge interrupts, and enabled by
                the guest.
